Questions to be answered:

How to Improve Purchases at Campaigns?
Which Customer Segment Should We Target?
Analysis Highlights We are trying to gather statistical data or find some type of correlations between certain segments and how much money they have been spending on specific campaigns.

Firstly, let's look at the age factor: From the following chart, we can conclude: The core audience for accepting campaigns right now is between 31-70 years old. Those aged 23-30 and 71 and up accept at higher rates.<img width="550" alt="Screenshot 2024-09-20 234120" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/160533a1-8c77-4870-af70-a6851c5589b2">

We analyzed marital status and found that married and single individuals are spending more money than widowed and divorced individuals. We should focus on this segment.

For the number of purchases made by people who accepted the campaigns,after performing regression analysis on the above three methods, we found:

All have a positive correlation: the more money spent, the more store purchases made.

From this, we can infer future directions: boost the higher percentage of catalog customers, or focus on in-store/web because they have more traffic.
